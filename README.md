# Vehicle Tracking System


## Introduction

With the help of this application, you can track the locations of the Buses and the battery-operated vehicles of IIT Bhubaneswar inside of the campus. You can also track the the number of unoccupied seats inside the vehicle. The location is tracked by mobile phone and Seats occupation is updated manually by drivers.

The prototype has already been been tested. In the prototype, the location is tracked by GPS Module and Seats occupation is monitored using Piezoelectric pressure sensors. Link: https://github.com/Rishabh606/VehicleTrackingSystem_Prototype

The phase 2 of the project will see this work done by IoT GPS enabled camera which will identify seats occupied using computer vision and send its location, solving the hassle of wires and bigger equipment.
